# My personal GitHub page

So this is the code of my GitHub page, which can be found here:
http://rominou34.github.io/

I'll mainly use this page as an english portfolio ( I already have a french one
at http://romainarnaud.fr with some pages translated in english but I prefer
to have a full english one )

You can copy and use the code all you want if you like the CSS and shit, I don't
really care, but please consider following me if you like my work as I don't
have many GitHub friends :/
