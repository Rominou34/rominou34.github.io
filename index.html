      <!-- INTRO !-->
      <h1>Romain Arnaud</h1>
      <div id="intro">
        Hi, I'm a 19 years old developper from France, currently finishing my
        2 years Computer Science diploma at the Technological Institute of
        Montpellier.<br/>
        I love web development, so I spend a lot of my free time developping
        <del>useless</del> random things. I also spend a lot of time playing
        video games and going out with friends, and I study a lot of things
        about planes as I'm taking lessons to get my Private Pilot License and
        I wish to become a pilot.

      <!-- SKILLS !-->
      <h2>Skills</h2>

      <h3>Web</h3>
      <div id="skills">
        I'm perfectly comfortable using <span id="html">HTML</span>,
        <span id="css">CSS</span> and <span id="javascript">Javascript</span> to
        do some front-end job, but I can also do back-end using
        <span id="php">PHP</span> and <span id="sql">SQL</span>
        <br/>
        I've also started to learn server-side programming in
        <span id="javascript">Javascript</span> using
        <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" id="meteor">Meteor</a> and
        <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" id="react">React</a>
      </div>

      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <div>
        I'm not a pro, but I can do some pretty good code using Java or C#, and
        I also know the basics about Python.
        <br/>
        I also learned a bit of C during my studies but it was a painful
        memory I'm trying to forget
      </div>

      <h3>Others</h3>
      <div>
        As a video games lover, I tried to learn a little bit of game development
        so I'm pretty good with Blender and I know the basics about Unity 3D
      </div>

            <span>Static website for the school</span>
            <p>As a group of 6 people, we had to develop a static website for
            the school ( IUT de Montpellier ) using HTML and CSS, and make it
            adapted to all devices using responsive design</p>

          <li>
            <span>[WIP] Multiplayer FPS</span>
            <p>As a big video games lover, I tried to develop my own game, so
            I started to create a basic multiplayer FPS using Unity. The project
            is now paused until the end of times, having only one weapon
            available ( but the multiplayer and scorboard system still works tho
            )</p>

          <li>
            <span>Fake online store website</span>
            <p>As a group of 3 people, we had to develop an Online store website
            ( a fake one, as it was just a student project ), using PHP and
            MySQL for the back-end, and HTML-CSS and Javascript for the front-end.
            <br/>The website worked fine but the database for the products keeps
            deleting itself for some reason
            </p>
